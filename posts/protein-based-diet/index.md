# Building a Healthy Protein-Based Diet: A Comprehensive Guide

As someone passionate about both fitness and nutrition, I've learned that a well-planned protein-based diet can be transformative for health, performance, and body composition. Let me share my insights on creating a sustainable and healthy protein-focused eating plan.

## Understanding Protein's Role

Protein is essential for:
- Muscle repair and growth
- Enzyme and hormone production
- Immune system function
- Satiety and weight management
- Maintaining healthy skin, hair, and nails

## Quality Protein Sources

### Animal-Based Proteins

- Turkey breast (29g protein per 100g)
- Fish (salmon: 25g protein per 100g)
- Egg whites (11g protein per 100g)
- Greek yogurt (10g protein per 100g)
- Lean beef (26g protein per 100g)

### Plant-Based Proteins
- Lentils (9g protein per 100g)
