TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. 
It helps catch errors early in development and provides better tooling support.

## Why TypeScript?

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time instead of runtime
- **Better IDE Support**: Enhanced autocomplete and refactoring capabilities
- **Improved Maintainability**: Code is self-documenting with type definitions
- **Modern JavaScript Features**: Use the latest ECMAScript features with backwards compatibility

## Core Concepts

### Basic Types

```typescript
// Basic types in TypeScript
let isDone: boolean = false;
let decimal: number = 6;
let color: string = "blue";
let list: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
```

### Interfaces

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  id: number;
  email?: string; // Optional property
}
```
