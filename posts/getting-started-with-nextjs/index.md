# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building web applications simple and efficient. 
It provides features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes out of the box.

## Why Choose Next.js?

Next.js has become the go-to framework for React applications because it offers:

- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with TypeScript, ESLint, and other tools
- **Hybrid Rendering**: Choose between SSR, SSG, or ISR based on your needs
- **Fast Refresh**: See your changes instantly during development
- **Built-in Optimizations**: Automatic image, font, and script optimization

## Key Features

### 1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Next.js can render pages on the server, providing:
- Better SEO performance
- Faster initial page loads
- Improved user experience

### 2. Static Site Generation (SSG)
Generate static pages at build time for:
- Maximum performance
- Lower server costs
- Better scalability

### 3. API Routes
Create API endpoints easily within your Next.js application:
```javascript
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello World!' })
}
```

### 4. File-System Routing
Next.js uses file-based routing:
- Pages are automatically routed based on their file name
- Dynamic routes using `[param]` syntax
- Nested routes for complex applications

### 5. Built-in CSS Support
Comprehensive styling solutions:
- CSS Modules
- Sass support
- Tailwind CSS integration
- CSS-in-JS solutions

## Getting Started

1. Create a new Next.js project:
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your application.

## Best Practices

1. **Use TypeScript**
   - Better type safety
   - Enhanced IDE support
   - Fewer runtime errors

2. **Optimize Images**
   ```jsx
   import Image from 'next/image'
   
   function MyImage() {
     return (
       <Image
         src="/my-image.jpg"
         alt="Description"
         width={500}
         height={300}
       />
     )
   }
   ```

3. **Implement Dynamic Imports**
   ```jsx
   import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'
   
   const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/heavy'))
   ```

## Conclusion

Next.js provides an excellent foundation for building modern web applications. Its features and optimizations make it a perfect choice for projects of any size, from small blogs to large-scale applications.
